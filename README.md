## Language Support

Zeonica should work well with most source files, but some languages have received special attention. Those that are known to show up very well with this theme are listed below:

* Batch
* C/C++
* C#
* CMake
* CSS
* HTML
* INI
* Java
* JavaScript
* JSON
* Makefile
* Markdown

## Coloring Issues

In order to create the best possible experience, Zeonica contains over 100 language-specific coloring rules. Nevertheless, shortcomings in various language grammars still prevent some source files from being displayed as intended. These issues cannot currently be addressed without improved language grammars.
